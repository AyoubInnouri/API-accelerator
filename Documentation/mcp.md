# How the Model Context Protocol (MCP) Works Technically

The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an open protocol that standardizes how large language models (LLMs) interact with external tools, data, and systems. It defines a clear interface between *clients* (applications hosting LLMs) and *servers* (which expose capabilities, resources, or data). MCP is designed to make LLM-powered applications extensible, composable, and interoperable — much like how HTTP unified web communication.

---

## 1. Architecture Overview

MCP relies on a **client–server model** built over **JSON-RPC 2.0**.

- **Client**: Usually the LLM application (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, or a custom AI agent) that wants to discover and invoke capabilities.  
- **Server**: A component exposing functions, resources, and prompts through the MCP interface. It can wrap a database, codebase, or API.  

The MCP architecture is structured into **two main layers**:
1. **Transport Layer Protocol** – handles connection management and message transport.  
2. **Data Layer Protocol** – defines the semantics of the JSON-RPC methods, schemas, and primitives exchanged between clients and servers.

## 2. Transport Layer Protocol

This layer manages how the client and server communicate — connection lifecycle, session initialization, and message exchange.  
It typically runs over **WebSockets**, **stdio**, or **local pipes**, allowing MCP to work in both cloud and local environments.

At startup:
1. The client opens a channel and sends an `initialize` request with its version and capabilities.  
2. The server responds with its own metadata and supported features.  
3. Once initialized, both sides can exchange structured JSON-RPC messages asynchronously.

---

## 3. Data Layer Protocol

This is the heart of MCP — it defines what the messages *mean*. The protocol standardizes the following primitives:

### a. Tools

**Tools** are executable functions provided by the server.

Each tool definition includes:
- `name`: identifier (e.g., `search_database`)
- `description`: short explanation
- `input_schema` and `output_schema`: JSON schemas describing input/output

A client can:
1. List available tools (`tools/list`)
2. Invoke a tool (`tools/call`)
3. Receive results or structured errors

**Example:**
```json
{
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "getWeather",
    "arguments": { "city": "Paris" }
  }
}
```

---

### b. Resources

**Resources** represent **data exposed by the server**, such as files, database tables, or structured metadata.

Clients can:
* **List** available resources (`resources/list`).
* **Read** the content of a resource (`resources/read`) to build necessary context before making decisions or invoking tools.

### c. Prompts

**Prompts** are **predefined templates** or instruction sets stored on the server.

Clients can:
* **Query** them (`prompts/list`).
* Use them to generate structured inputs or context for **LLM reasoning**.

### d. Client-Side Primitives

The server can also initiate requests **to the client** (the LLM host), introducing a **bidirectional capability**. This allows the server to delegate reasoning or user interaction back to the LLM host.

| Primitive | Action | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Sampling** | Asking the client to generate a model completion | `sampling/complete` |
| **Elucidation** | Asking the client to obtain clarification from the user | `elicit` |
| **Logging** | Sending logs or telemetry data | (No standard method specified, but used for reporting) |

## 4. Notifications and Updates

MCP supports **notifications**, which are **one-way messages** that do not expect a response.

* **Example**: When a server updates its toolset, it can send `notifications/tools/list_changed`.

This mechanism keeps the client in sync **without polling**, improving efficiency and real-time awareness of system changes.

***

## 5. Example Exchange Flow

Here’s a simplified flow demonstrating the structured communication in MCP:

1.  **Initialization**
    * **Client → Server**: `initialize`
    * **Server → Client**: `capabilities + metadata`
2.  **Discovery**
    * **Client → Server**: `tools/list`
    * **Server → Client**: returns available tools
3.  **Invocation**
    * **Client → Server**: `tools/call` with parameters
    * **Server → Client**: execution result
4.  **Notification**
    * **Server → Client**: `notifications/resources/updated` (Asynchronous update)

Through these structured interactions, the LLM environment becomes aware of external systems and can act upon them safely and deterministically.

***

## 6. Why MCP Matters

Traditional LLM integrations are typically **ad-hoc** (each vendor defines its own API format). MCP introduces:

* **Interoperability**: Any MCP client can talk to any MCP server.
* **Discoverability**: Clients can dynamically list available tools and resources.
* **Context Standardization**: Resources and prompts are described in consistent schemas.
* **Two-way Reasoning**: Servers can leverage model power for intelligent tasks (via Client-Side Primitives).

By standardizing the model–tool interface, MCP aims to become the **“language of context”** for AI systems, enabling open, modular ecosystems of LLM agents and services.

## 7. Technical Summary

| Concept | Description | Example Method |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Tool** | Executable function | `tools/call` |
| **Resource** | Data or file provided by the server | `resources/read` |
| **Prompt** | Predefined template | `prompts/list` |
| **Sampling** | Model completion requested by server | `sampling/complete` |
| **Notification** | Unidirectional update | `notifications/tools/list_changed` |

## 8. In Practice

A developer can implement an **MCP server** to securely expose internal APIs or documents to an AI system.

An **LLM client** then uses MCP to:
1.  **Discover** the server’s capabilities.
2.  **Choose and execute** the right tools.
3.  **Integrate** results into reasoning chains.

Because MCP runs over standard protocols and uses JSON schemas, it’s **language-agnostic** and **easy to extend**.

### In Short

Technically, **MCP acts as the standard bridge between LLMs and the external world**, defining a unified way to describe, invoke, and manage context—so that any AI model can interact with any system, using a common, predictable protocol.
